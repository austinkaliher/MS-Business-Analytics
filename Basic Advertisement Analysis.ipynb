    "# Basic Advertisement Analysis\n",
    "## By: Austin Kaliher\n",
    "### This assignment was originally created for APRD 6342 (Digital Advertising) at the Univeristy of Colorado Boulder. The task at hand was to conduct some basic analysis on an Facebook advertising data set from an online travel booking site. The original questions and answers are included below and the data is available in my repository."
