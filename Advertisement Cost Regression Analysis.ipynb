    "# Advertisement Cost Regression Analysis\n",
    "## By: Austin Kaliher\n",
    "### This is a python script originally created for APRD 6342 (Digital Advertising) at the University of Colorado Boulder. In this assignment, we were tasked with finding out what drives clicks on Facebook advertisements for an online travel booking company. To do this, we constructed a multiple linear regression. The data for this code is available in my repository. Included below are the original questions and answers."
